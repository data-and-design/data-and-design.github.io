# Final Project

The goal of the final project is to design and prototype an assistive technology. The project should be developed in a team. The project can be developed using any technologies the students prefer.

The students can propose their own project or select a project from a list of project ideas provided by the instructor. Proposed projects will require instructor approval.

<h2 id="milestone-1">Milestone 1: Team composition</h2>

Form teams and enter them into Canvas.

Undergrads: Form teams of 4–5

Grad students: You may work alone or form a team with other grad students

<h2 id="milestone-2">Milestone 2: Define a project</h2>

### Suggested projects

Pick a project from this list:

- Develop a new feature for the [Olli](https://github.com/umwelt-data/olli) open source library
    - Spatial navigation
    - Custom key bindings
    - Customizable text descriptions
    - Geospatial map support
    - Diagram / relational graph support
- Create an example gallery and documentation for the [Umwelt](https://github.com/umwelt-data/umwelt) accessible data tool

### Proposing a project

Teams that want to propose a project have to submit a short proposal answering these questions:
- What is the problem you want to solve?
- How do you know that this is a real problem that disabled people experience?
    - e.g. Does this project draw on the lived experiences of a team member? Is it based on empirical research into the needs and perspectives of disabled people?
- What is the solution you want to propose?
- How do you plan to implement it?

Before you submit, it's **strongly encouraged** that you talk to the instructor for feedback on your idea.

<h2 id="milestone-3">Milestone 3: Make a plan</h2>

Develop a more fully fleshed out project plan that addresses the following:
- What is the problem?
- What is the proposed solution?
- What will it take to develop the solution?
    - Include a set of tasks and a week-by-week plan
    - Make sure it is realistic and achievable in one semester
- How will you split the work?
    - Describe how the work will be split equally and fairly among the team members
- How will you evaluate your solution?
    - Describe your plan to figure out whether you have achieved your goals

<h2 id="milestone-4">Milestone 4: Present in class</h2>

Every group will give a 5 minute project pitch during class and receive feedback from the class.

<h2 id="weekly-updates">Milestones 5–10: Weekly Updates</h2>

Every week, each group must submit a project advancement report. The report is made up of short answers to the following questions:
- What have you accomplished this week?
- What has each member worked on?
- Are there any unanticipated issues?
- Do you need help or feedback from me?
- Are you on track with your plan?
- What do you plan to do next week?
 
<h2 id="final-presentation">Final Presentation</h2>

Groups will present their final project in-class or at the INFO Showcase.

<h2 id="final-report">Final Project Report</h2>

Groups will submit a final report on their project with the following outline:
