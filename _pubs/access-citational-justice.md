### Abstract

In accessibility research involving human subjects, researchers conventionally anonymize their research participants to protect privacy. However, a lack of intentionality about who to publicly acknowledge for intellectual contributions to research can lead to the erasure of disabled individualsâ€™ work and knowledge. In this paper, I propose identifying disabled research participants by name (with consent) as a practice of citational justice. I share observations from examples of this practice in accessible visualization research, and offer considerations for when it may be appropriate to de-anonymize. Intentional practices of citation offer researchers an opportunity to acknowledge the expertise and intellectual contributions of disabled people in our communities.
