## PhD applicants

The <span class="dnd">Data & Design</span> Group primarily recruits PhD students through the [PhD in Information Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience/phd-information-science).

<a href="/recruiting/phd" class="arrow-link"><span class="cta">Information for PhD applicants <span aria-hidden>&rarr;</span></span></a>

_Applications due Dec 1._

## MS applicants

Prospective students can also apply to join the group via the [MS in Information Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience/ms-information-science), a research oriented Master's program.

## CU Undergrads

The lab welcomes undergraduates who are curious about research and excited to learn. You don't need prior research experienceâ€”just enthusiasm and clear goals for what you want to gain from the experience (even if that goal is figuring out whether research is right for you!).

Students can get involved in undergraduate research or apply to the BAM program (combined bachelors and masters).
