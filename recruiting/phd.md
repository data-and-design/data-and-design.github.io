The <span class="dnd">Data & Design</span> Group is a research group in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. This page contains information for prospective Ph.D. students about our research, what we can accomplish together, and how to apply.

I'm recruiting Ph.D. students to join the <span class="dnd">D&D</span> group in Fall 2025 (**applications due December 1, 2024**).

## Why am I looking for PhD students?

The world needs people who are trained to think deeply about the relationship between technology and society, _and_ are able to put those ideas into practice by creating new technology.

At the <span class="dnd">Data & Design</span> Group, we are creating a collaborative and inclusive space for people to grow into interdisciplinary researchers that are equipped to respond to society's needs.

## What kind of work does the <span class="dnd">D&D</span> Group do?

We're interested in work that can both contribute new ideas to scientific communities, and also make a practical difference in people's everyday lives.

We're primarily doing this work in the areas of _accessible data visualization_ and _data ethics_. What do these areas have in common? We want to understand how system design can shape inclusion and exclusion in society. Making software is a way to study this relationship and also work to create change.

**Accessible data visualization**

We partner with blind / low-vision (BLV) collaborators to design tools for non-visual data exploration. These tools support the autonomy and agency of BLV people to conduct data analysis.

Example projects:

- [Olli](/projects/olli/), a toolkit for converting visualizations into structured textual descriptions
- [Umwelt](/projects/umwelt/), an accessible editor for representing data with visuals, text, and sound

Example papers:

- [Rich Screen Reader Experiences for Accessible Data Visualization](/publications/rich-screen-reader-vis-experiences/)
- <span style="margin-left: -0.25em">“</span>[Customization is Key”: Reconfigurable Content Tokens for Accessible Data Visualizations](/publications/customization/)
- [Umwelt: Accessible Structured Editing of Multi-Modal Data Representations](/publications/umwelt/)

**Data ethics**

We design systems and create conceptual frameworks that help people say “no” to large-scale data collection that they don't want to be part of.

Example papers:

- [Bartleby: Procedural and Substantive Ethics in the Design of Research Ethics Systems](/publications/bartleby/)
- [Data Refusal from Below: A Framework for Understanding, Evaluating, and Envisioning Refusal as Design](/publications/data-refusal/)

## What can a new student expect to work on?

As a new Ph.D. student joining the group, you'll work with me to identify a project that builds on the group's existing work in accessibility or data ethics. Working with you on an initial project where I have more upfront involvement in scoping the project is a way for me to scaffold your learning experience as a junior researcher. As you progress in your Ph.D., I expect that we will work together to develop projects that closely reflect your goals and interests and advance your growth as an independent researcher.

## What kind of applicants am I looking for?

I am looking for applicants who:

- are excited to contribute to and shape the shared research trajectory of the group
- want to build interdisciplinary skills across engineering, design, social sciences, and the humanities
- can help create a welcoming and inclusive research group culture
- have the potential to grow into leaders in our group, the department, and our wider research communities

I'm committed to building a group where people are able to bring diverse lived experiences, interests, and disciplinary perspectives in conversation together.

As you think about working with me, I also encourage you to consider other [faculty in Information Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/information-science) who you might have common interests with, who might be potential future mentors, collaborators, or committee members.

## What is my perspective on advising?

The goal of a Ph.D. is to launch your career as a researcher (whether in academia, industry, civil service, or otherwise). In that process, an advisor plays many roles at different times: collaborator, thought partner, coach, advocate, and more. At a baseline, I believe successful advising relationships require trust, proactive communication, and clear expectation setting from both parties.

Acknowledging that people enter grad school with different goals and experiences, I see my job as figuring out how I can best help you succeed. Sometimes this will mean challenging you to stretch your capabilities so you can grow; other times, it will mean getting out of the way so you can fully exercise your agency.

## How does one apply?

Apply through the CU Boulder application system, linked below. In your cover letter, please name me as a prospective advisor so that I see your application.
