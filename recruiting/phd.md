The <span class="dnd">Data & Design</span> Group is a research group in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. This page contains information for prospective Ph.D. students about our research, what we can accomplish together, and how to apply.

I'm recruiting Ph.D. students to join the <span class="dnd">D&D</span> group in Fall 2026 (**applications due December 1, 2025**).

## Why am I looking for PhD students?

The world needs people who are trained to think deeply about the relationship between technology and society, _and_ are able to put those ideas into practice by creating new technology.

At the <span class="dnd">Data & Design</span> Group, we are creating a collaborative and inclusive space for people to grow into interdisciplinary researchers that are equipped to respond to society's needs.

## What kind of work does the <span class="dnd">D&D</span> Group do?

We're interested in work that can both contribute new ideas to scientific communities, and also make a practical difference in people's everyday lives.

We're primarily doing this work in the areas of _accessible data visualization_ and _data ethics_. What do these areas have in common? We want to understand how system design can shape inclusion and exclusion in society. Making software is a way to study this relationship and also work to create change.

**Accessible data visualization**

We partner with blind / low-vision (BLV) collaborators to design tools for non-visual data exploration. These tools support the autonomy and agency of BLV people to conduct data analysis.

Example projects:

- [Olli](/projects/olli/), a toolkit for converting visualizations into structured textual descriptions
- [Umwelt](/projects/umwelt/), an accessible editor for representing data with visuals, text, and sound

Example papers:

- [Rich Screen Reader Experiences for Accessible Data Visualization](/publications/rich-screen-reader-vis-experiences/)
- <span style="margin-left: -0.25em">“</span>[Customization is Key”: Reconfigurable Content Tokens for Accessible Data Visualizations](/publications/customization/)
- [Umwelt: Accessible Structured Editing of Multi-Modal Data Representations](/publications/umwelt/)

**Data ethics**

We design systems and create conceptual frameworks that help people say “no” to large-scale data collection that they don't want to be part of.

Example papers:

- [Bartleby: Procedural and Substantive Ethics in the Design of Research Ethics Systems](/publications/bartleby/)
- [Data Refusal from Below: A Framework for Understanding, Evaluating, and Envisioning Refusal as Design](/publications/data-refusal/)

## What can a new student expect to work on?

As a new Ph.D. student joining the group, you'll work with me to identify a project that builds on the group's existing work in accessibility or data ethics. Working with you on an initial project where I have more upfront involvement in scoping the project is a way for me to scaffold your learning experience as a junior researcher. As you progress in your Ph.D., I expect that we will work together to develop projects that closely reflect your goals and interests and advance your growth as an independent researcher.

## How are students funded?

Generally, admitted students in our program are guaranteed funding for at least 4 years, and are funded through a combination of TA positions, RA positions, and external fellowships.

The research group has funding to fully support at least one new student this year.

I expect students to gain experience as both TAs and RAs during their Ph.D. journey, and actively pursue external funding with my support. I believe all of these funding avenues provide valuable experiences for a junior researcher. For instance, being a teaching assistant develops valuable skills in public communication, equitable leadership, and invests in our field's future. Research assistantships grow your research skills while contributing to the group's broader research trajectory. And seeking external funding through fellowships is an important way to develop the communication and visioning skills to make your work legible and exciting to others.

## What kind of applicants am I looking for?

I'm looking for applicants who are excited to contribute to and shape the shared research trajectory of the group. Specifically, I'm seeking students who:

- are curious about building interdisciplinary skills across engineering, design, social sciences, and the humanities
- want to help create a welcoming and inclusive research group culture
- are eager to develop as leaders in our group, the department, and our wider research communities

I'm committed to building a group where people can bring diverse lived experiences, interests, and disciplinary perspectives into conversation together. In return, you'll join a collaborative community focused on mutual growth, where I'll work with you to develop your vision as an independent researcher.

**What I'm looking for in your application:** I want to understand your research interests and goals for the PhD, how you see your interests connecting to the lab's work, and what you hope to accomplish. I want to know what motivates you, what activates your curiosity, and what path has led you here—why is pursuing a PhD the right next step for you? I encourage you to explore our projects and papers to get a sense of what we do and how you might contribute.

This year, I'm particularly interested in students with background and/or strong interest in **accessibility, visualization, and design**—especially those who want to **critically reimagine accessibility tools**. However, relevant background can come from many different disciplinary paths, and I will seriously consider applications that connect with any area of the group's work as described above.

As you think about working with me, I also encourage you to consider other [faculty in Information Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/information-science) who you might have common interests with, who might be potential future mentors, collaborators, or committee members.

## What is my perspective on advising?

The goal of a Ph.D. is to launch your career as a researcher (whether in academia, industry, civil service, or otherwise). In that process, an advisor plays many roles at different times: collaborator, thought partner, coach, advocate, and more. At a baseline, I believe successful advising relationships require trust, proactive communication, and clear expectation setting from both parties.

Acknowledging that people enter grad school with different goals and experiences, I see my job as figuring out how I can best help you succeed. Sometimes this will mean challenging you to stretch your capabilities so you can grow; other times, it will mean getting out of the way so you can fully exercise your agency.

## How does one apply?

Apply through the CU Boulder application system, linked below. In your cover letter, please name me as a prospective advisor so that I see your application.

**About reaching out:** You're welcome to email me at <a href="mailto:jzong@colorado.edu">jzong@colorado.edu</a> if you have questions or want to learn more about the research group. I receive a high volume of emails during application season, so I do my best to respond to specific questions but may not be able to reply to everyone. Please know that not reaching out won't disadvantage you in the application process—I'm committed to giving every application careful consideration regardless of whether we've been in touch beforehand.
