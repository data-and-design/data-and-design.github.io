**Interested in joining the lab?** There are two ways undergraduates can get involved in research with our group:

## Path 1: Undergrad research projects
I welcome undergraduates who are curious about research and excited to learn. You don't need prior research experience—just enthusiasm and clear goals for what you want to gain from the experience (even if that goal is figuring out whether research is right for you!).

If you're interested, please [email Jonathan](mailto:jzong@colorado.edu) with:
- A brief statement about your interests and goals: What draws you to research? What do you hope to learn or accomplish?
- How you see yourself contributing to the lab's work (take some time to explore our projects and papers to get a sense of what we do)
- Your resume, so I can understand what skills and experiences you'd bring

What you'll gain:
- Participate in group meetings where we discuss exciting ideas, give each other feedback on projects, and build a supportive intellectual community
- Work on open-source projects that have real-world impact
- Potentially earn credit hours through independent study or an honors thesis (if you're an information science major)
- Potentially be paid through the [UROP program](https://www.colorado.edu/urop/applying/student-grant-proposals/assistantships).

**A few things to know:**
- Taking a class with me first is highly recommended—it helps us get to know each other and ensures you're familiar with the kind of work we do
- Research positions depend on current project needs and mentor availability, so I may not always be able to accommodate everyone who reaches out

I'm primarily looking for curiosity, excitement about the research, and thoughtfulness about your goals. If that sounds like you, I'd love to hear from you!

## Path 2: BAM (combined Bachelor's and Master's) program
If you're a junior interested in engaging with research more deeply, consider applying to the BAM program. This is a structured path that combines your undergraduate and graduate studies, with research as a central component.
