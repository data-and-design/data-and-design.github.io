The <span class="dnd">Data & Design</span> Group is a research group in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. This page contains information for prospective M.S. students about our research, what we can accomplish together, and how to apply.

M.S. applications are **due February 1**. I review M.S. applications every year, but capacity is shaped by a variety of factors (including project and mentorship availability).

## Why am I looking for MS students?

The world needs people who are trained to think deeply about the relationship between technology and society, _and_ are able to put those ideas into practice by creating new technology.

At the <span class="dnd">Data & Design</span> Group, we are creating a collaborative and inclusive space for people to develop as interdisciplinary researchers that are equipped to respond to society's needs.

## Who is the MS program for?

This is a research-based M.S. program, which means a significant component of your time will be spent developing and conducting an independent research project—somewhat like the first year of a PhD. This makes the program a good fit if you're looking to build substantial research experience, not just coursework credentials.

The M.S. might be right for you if you're transitioning into information science from another field and want structured time to develop new skills and domain knowledge. If your goal is to bring research skills into an industry or public-sector career, this program can also help you develop those capabilities.

It can also be a good way to explore whether research is something you want to pursue long-term, without the commitment of a PhD. Some students use the M.S. to build a stronger portfolio of research experience before applying to doctoral programs. 

## What kind of work does the <span class="dnd">D&D</span> Group do?

We're interested in work that can both contribute new ideas to scientific communities, and also make a practical difference in people's everyday lives.

We're primarily doing this work in the areas of _accessible data visualization_ and _data ethics_. What do these areas have in common? We want to understand how system design can shape inclusion and exclusion in society. Making software is a way to study this relationship and also work to create change.

**Accessible data visualization**

We partner with blind / low-vision (BLV) collaborators to design tools for non-visual data exploration. These tools support the autonomy and agency of BLV people to conduct data analysis.

Example projects:

- [Olli](/projects/olli/), a toolkit for converting visualizations into structured textual descriptions
- [Umwelt](/projects/umwelt/), an accessible editor for representing data with visuals, text, and sound

Example papers:

- [Rich Screen Reader Experiences for Accessible Data Visualization](/publications/rich-screen-reader-vis-experiences/)
- <span style="margin-left: -0.25em">“</span>[Customization is Key”: Reconfigurable Content Tokens for Accessible Data Visualizations](/publications/customization/)
- [Umwelt: Accessible Structured Editing of Multi-Modal Data Representations](/publications/umwelt/)

**Data ethics**

We design systems and create conceptual frameworks that help people say “no” to large-scale data collection that they don't want to be part of.

Example papers:

- [Bartleby: Procedural and Substantive Ethics in the Design of Research Ethics Systems](/publications/bartleby/)
- [Data Refusal from Below: A Framework for Understanding, Evaluating, and Envisioning Refusal as Design](/publications/data-refusal/)

## What can a new M.S. student expect to work on?

As a new M.S. student joining the group, you'll work with me to on a project that builds on the group's existing work in accessibility or data ethics. For an idea of the kinds of things this could be, look at the recent projects above. Given the shorter timeline of the M.S., we'll work together to scope a project that's achievable within your program while still making a meaningful contribution.

## What kind of applicants am I looking for?

I'm looking for applicants who are excited to contribute to and shape the shared research trajectory of the group. Specifically, I'm seeking students who:

- are curious about building interdisciplinary skills across engineering, design, social sciences, and the humanities
- want to help create a welcoming and inclusive research group culture
- are eager to grow within our group and contribute to our wider research communities

I'm committed to building a group where people can bring diverse lived experiences, interests, and disciplinary perspectives into conversation together. In return, you'll join a collaborative community focused on mutual growth, where I'll work with you to develop toward your careers goals, whether in academia, industry, or civil society.

**What I'm looking for in your application:** I want to understand your research interests and goals for the M.S., how you see your interests connecting to the lab's work, and what you hope to accomplish. I want to know what motivates you, what activates your curiosity, and what path has led you here—why is pursuing a research-based M.S. the right next step for you? I encourage you to explore our projects and papers to get a sense of what we do and how you might contribute.

As you think about working with me, I also encourage you to consider other [faculty in Information Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/information-science) who you might have common interests with, who might be potential future mentors, collaborators, or committee members.

## How does one apply?

Apply through the CU Boulder application system, linked below. In your research statement, please name me as a prospective advisor so that I see your application.

**About reaching out:** You're welcome to email me at <a href="mailto:jzong@colorado.edu">jzong@colorado.edu</a> if you have questions or want to learn more about the research group. I receive a high volume of emails during application season, so I do my best to respond to specific questions but may not be able to reply to everyone. Please know that not reaching out won't disadvantage you in the application process—I'm committed to giving every application careful consideration regardless of whether we've been in touch beforehand.
